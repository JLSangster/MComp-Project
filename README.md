# MComp-Project: Comparison of the Power Consumption vs Accuracy of Decision Tree and Convolutional Neural Network Solutions for Image Classification of Polyhedral Dice.   Jacqueline Sangster SAN16602715

To compare power consumption vs accuracy of both decision trees and CNNs, example models were created, using SKLearn and Keras respectively. This code includes both the building and testing of each model. In order to run the testing code the model.py code should be ran first to compile the models.
